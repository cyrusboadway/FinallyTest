I wrote these tests to explore how return statements
inside of try-finally blocks interact. I was curious
about how a finally block might change the value
being returned. In retrospect, the conclusion is
quite obvious. I tested three languages which support
the finally block (Java, Python, Javascript), and all
acted in the same way: the value being returned is
evaluated first, stored as a separate value in
memory, after which the finally block is executed. Of
course, though it's bad form, the finally statement
can always override what is being returned by
executing another return statement.

For the record, here are the compilation & execution
specifics, not that it's terribly germane given the
conclusion:

OS: Linux 3.0.0-16-generic #28-Ubuntu x86_64 GNU/Linux
Java: Java Version 1.6.0_22 from Sun Microsystems Inc
Python: Python 2.7.2+
Javascript: Chrome 17 (V8 3.6.6.3)
